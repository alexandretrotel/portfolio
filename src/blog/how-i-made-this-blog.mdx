# How I made this blog?

Hi and welcome to my blog! I wanted to share with you how I built it with **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**. It&apos;s not too hard, and I'll explain it in a simple way. You can find the code on **[GitHub](https://github.com/alexandretrotel/portfolio)**. Let's go through it step by step.

## Understanding the blog structure

My blog shows a list of posts. Each post has:

- A **title** (like `How I made this blog?`).
- A **date** (when I wrote it).
- A **slug** (a short name for the link, like `how-i-made-this-blog`).

When you visit the blog page, you see all the posts. You can click a title to read more. It looks clean and simple like I wanted it to be (minimalist).

## Showing all posts

I made a file called `page.mdx` for the blog. This is the main page. Here's how it works:

- I use a framework called **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**. It helps me build web application fast.
- I get the list of posts from a function called `getBlogPosts()`. This function takes all my posts and puts them in order (newest first).
- The page shows a table with the date and title of each post.
- If you click a title, it takes you to a new page like `/blog/how-i-made-this-blog`.

## How to store the content

My posts are saved in a file called `posts.ts`. It's a data structure that contain all the posts with their `title`, `date` and `slug`. The `getBlogPosts()` function takes this list and sorts it by date. New posts go at the top.

## Styling the blog

I wanted my blog to look good and **_minimalist_**. So, I added some **styles**. Styles are like rules for how things look (big text, colors, etc.). I used a file called `mdx-components.tsx` to do this. Here's what I changed:

- **Titles (h1, h2, h3)**: Big and bold so they stand out.
- **Paragraphs (p)**: Easy to read with space between lines.
- **Quotes (blockquote)**: A line on the left and italic text.
- **Lists (ul, ol)**: Bullets or numbers with space around them.
- **Links (a)**: Colored and underlined so you know you can click them.
- **Images (img)**: Big and clear so you can see them well.

These styles make my blog pretty and easy to use.

## Tools I used

Here are the main tools I used:

- **Next.js**: For building the web app.
- **MDX**: For writing pages with code and text together.
- **TypeScript**: To keep my code safe and organized (like saying a title must be text, not a number).

I also made a `types.ts` file. It tells the code what a "post" is: a `title`, a `slug`, and a `date`. This helps me avoid mistakes and be more productive.

## How it all works together

1. I write posts in `posts.ts`.
2. The `getBlogPosts()` function sorts them.
3. The `page.tsx` file show them in a table.
4. When you click a title, NextJS takes you to the post's page (like `how-i-made-this-blog.mdx`).
5. Styles in `mdx-components.tsx` make everything look nice.

That's it! My blog is simple but works well for me and my readers (_i guess_).

## Why did I make it this way?

I like my blog because:

- It's easy to add new posts. (_i just write markdown_)
- It looks clean and professional.
- I can share my ideas with people.

Thanks for reading! See you later for more posts. Bye!
