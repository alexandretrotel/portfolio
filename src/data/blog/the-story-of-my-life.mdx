# The story of my life

I've always wanted to summarize my life somewhere, so I decided to do it here.

To be honest, I've always thought I had a **special life**. Not because I have money, not because I'm famous because none of that is _yet_ true.

It's rather because I have some _great_ skills, but be careful, **I'm not a genius**. I'm just a normal guy that works a lot and is curious about so many things.

I'm also lucky because what I like is deeply aligned with what the society puts value on. This is what [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) is about, however, I feel like I'm still looking for it.

## Chapter 1 - The beginning

I don't remember much about when I was a baby.

I guess it's normal, but there's something not _usual about me_. I was born in Russia, in a small town called [Omsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omsk).

To be honest, I don't know that town very well. It may sounds weird, but I was adopted and raised in France.

However, I consider myself **100%** French, so I kind of feel being a _fraud_ when I say I'm Russian, but still I have both nationalities and that's cool!
